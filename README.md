AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is a live-action portfolio of my skills in Azure administration. It documents my hands-on-keyboard work as I prepare for the AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator certification.

## My Goal

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate practical, real-world skills in managing and deploying Azure resources. My focus is heavily on **automation and scripting** to show how I can build efficient, repeatable, and scalable solutions in the cloud.

## Technologies I'm Showcasing

For each lab, I perform the deployments using multiple methods to demonstrate a versatile skill set:

*   **Azure PowerShell:** Using the `Az` module for powerful scripting.
*   **Azure CLI:** Using the `az` command-line for flexible management.
*   **ARM Templates:** Using JSON to define Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
*   **Bicep:** Using the modern Bicep language to simplify IaC.

## How This Repository is Organized

The folders are structured according to the main objective areas of the AZ-104 exam. Inside each folder, you will find specific labs, each containing the scripts, templates, and screenshots of the successful deployments.

## My Microsoft Learn Achievements

I believe in continuous learning. You can view my completed training modules and achievements on my public Microsoft Learn profile:
